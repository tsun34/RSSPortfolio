Lucky Team 13 is comprised of four MIT undergraduates from MIT's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department. Find out more information about us below! While each member brings a different technical background to the team, our combined effort creates a machine and system that is greater than the sum of its parts. The team's interest in autonomous vehicles, as well as motivation to excel in coursework, will propel the team to have a successful race car by the end of the semester.
